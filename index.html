          11/15/2018 An October 2017 research brief on Florida's affordable
          rental housing needs shows that the state added 560,713 renters
          between 2005 and 2015. These include new households formed, households
          moving to the state, and homeowners shifting to renting. The state
          lost 130,267 owner households during the same period.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015, 744,662 low-income renters paid more than 40 percent of their
          income for housing--a 35 percent from 2005.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Center also released briefs on regional rental housing trends in
          South Florida, Northeast Florida, the Orlando area, and the Tampa Bay
          area.
